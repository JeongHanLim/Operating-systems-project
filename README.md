# Operating-systems-project
Showed how to execute threads in NACHOS, control scheduling of threads, and prevent interleavings and race conditions through process synchronization. Also completed a virtual memory implementation.

Change your working directory to the right folder by typing cd ~/nachos-exp1-2/<your folder>. Compile Nachos by typing make. If you see "ln -sf arch/intel-i386-linux/bin/nachos nachos” at the end of the compiling output, your compilation is successful. If you encounter any anomalies, type make clean to remove all object and executable files and then type make again for a clean compilation.
  
Trace a run of this Nachos test program by typing ./nachos -d > output_1.txt. Option –d is to display Nachos debugging messages.
